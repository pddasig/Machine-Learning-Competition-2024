Download fracture_identification folder from the git repo (type in "git lfs clone https://github.com/pddasig/Machine-Learning-Competition-2024.git" in your command prompt) and put it into your google drive (/content/gdrive/My Drive/fracture_identification/). 
Then you can run a draft notebook "2024_PDDA_ML_competition.ipynb" for fracture detections.
If you have any questions or need clarifications, send an email to "pdda_sig@spwla.org". Thank you!

Note: We will update this README for answering questions and sharing information, stay tuned!

**UPDATES:**
1. For the submission, it seems like the Codalab bug is caused by the deprecation of mutation events in Chrome (probably Edge and Explorer too). It still runs on Firefox so participants are recommended to submit using Firefox.
2. Competition is successfully completed and the answers for fracture locations and their images are uploaded in our repo.
3. We are designing our next ML competition and you are welcome to submit your idea or suggestions! (pdda_sig@spwla.org)


Announcing the Winners of SPWLA PDDA 2024 ML Competition!

We are thrilled to announce the winners of the SPWLA Petrophysical Data-Driven Analysis (PDDA) 2024 Machine Learning Competition! This year‚Äôs competition saw outstanding participation from talented teams worldwide, pushing the boundaries of resistivity image log analysis for fracture identifications through innovative machine learning approaches.

Top 5 Winning Teams: 
ü•á Vdehdari ‚Äì F1 Score: 0.6667
